			<h4>Details and motivation</h4>
			<p>
				Le Mans Ultimate (LMU) is a sim racing game developed by Studio 397 as a successor to rFactor 2.
				The game does not feature a dedicated server,
				so online multiplayer can only be done through their online system, Race Control.
				They do provide a way to host your own races, however the experience is severely lacking.
				In addition, a major aspect of the game is the ability to compete in team endurance races.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, such events would be hosted by third-parties using the dedicated server,
				with a live timing service, such as <a href="rf2livetiming.html">rf2livetiming</a>, hooked up to it.
				The current state of the server, live standings, and best lap times would always be available outside of the game.
				Even within the game, Le Mans Ultimate disappoints.
				As of February 1st, 2026,
				it is still impossible to view your own (or anyone else's) past lap times for the current session,
				a feature found in all of LMU's predecessors, every other sim racing game, and LMU itself until they removed it.
			</p>
			<p>
				LMUSessionTracker strives to be a solution for session information the game user interface lacks,
				while also providing features reminiscent of classic server live timing services.
				This project specifically targets supporting team endurance events and hosted sessions.
				All team members (or hosted session drivers) can use the client and through a combination of session properties
				(type, time, phase, entries, etc) identified as the same session.
				Only one client will provide the majority of the data.
				The others will sit (effectively) idle,
				but may be promoted when the main data provider leaves the session or disconnects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Session identification through the REST API endpoints is nontrivial.
				Endpoints may return data inconsistent with each other, or not at all.
				Care is taken to prevent the client from sending these "bad" states,
				which are most common during session transitions, loading, and entering/exiting the car.
